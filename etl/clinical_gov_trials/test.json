The DSST consists of rows containing small blank squares, each paired with a randomly assigned numbers 1-9. Above the rows is a key that pairs each number with a symbol. The subject must fill in the blank spaces with the matching symbol that is in the key. For the Subcopy tests the subject simply copies the symbol above each empty square.

Responses are recorded on a Likert scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The checklist contains 120 questions. The standardized score is computed by determining the z-score by subtracting the mean for the subject's age group and gender from the raw score and then dividing this by the standard deviation for the subject's age group and gender. Next, multiply the zscore by 15 and then add 100. For activities scale, social scale, school scale, and total competence scale, higher values indicate higher competencies. For Internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and total problems, higher values indicate more problems.",

The C-SSRS contained questions about suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. Subjects were placed into categories for suicidal behavior and for suicidal ideation based on their responses to various questions. Any suicidality was defined as suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. The suicidal behavior categories were determined based on the response to the questions under suicidal behavior (Completed Suicide, Actual Attempt, Interrupted Attempt, Aborted Attempt, Preparatory Acts or Behavior).The suicidal ideation categories were determined by examining the response to 5 questions under suicidal ideation (Wish to be Dead, Nonspecific Active Suicidal Thoughts, Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act, Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan, Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent).",

The subject was given 90 seconds to complete as many substitutions of symbols as possible according to a code provided on top of the sheet. The Coding Copy Subtest A was used for subjects 6 to 7 years of age, the Coding Copy Subtest B was used for subjects 8 to 16 years of age, and the DSST was used for subjects 17 years of age. The DSST consists of rows containing small blank squares, each paired with a randomly assigned numbers 1-9. Above the rows is a key that pairs each number with a symbol. The subject must fill in the blank spaces with the matching symbol that is in the key. For the Subcopy tests the subject simply copies the symbol above each empty square. Scaled scores are used to account for age differences among test takers. Scaled scores range from 1 to 19, and higher scores indicate higher cognitive function.",

Responses are recorded on a Likert scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The checklist contains 120 questions. The standardized score is computed by determining the z-score by subtracting the mean for the subject's age group and gender from the raw score and then dividing this by the standard deviation for the subject's age group and gender. Next, multiply the zscore by 15 and then add 100. For activities scale, social scale, school scale, and total competence scale, higher values indicate higher competencies. For Internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and total problems, higher values indicate more problems.",

The scale asked questions about the child's physical wellness, feelings, behavior, and activities at school and with family and friends. The SF-10 physical and psychosocial summary measures were scored such that higher scores indicated more favorable functioning. The Physical Summary Score is computed by summing values for questions 1, 2a, 2b, 3 and 5 and standardizing scores by normalizing to a total possible score of 0-100 with higher scores representing more positive indications. The Psychosocial Summary Score is computed by summing questions 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and standardizing scores by normalizing to a total possible score of 0-100 with higher scores representing more positive indications.",
